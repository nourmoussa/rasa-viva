  - text: Making changes to what you eat and drink can have a significant effect on your weight, and therefore your cardiovascular risk. My recommendations are based on the best tips recommended by the NHS to maintain a healthy weight.

  utter_managealco1:
  - text: A standard glass of wine can contain as many calories as a piece of chocolate. Over time, drinking too much can easily contribute to weight gain, which has been shown to increase your risk of morbidities associated to cardiovascular disease. If interested here is a comparison between the calorie contents of different drinks https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/alcohol-advice/calories-in-alcohol/
  utter_managealco2:
  - text: Men and women are advised to not regularly drink more than 14 units a week. One tip I could suggest is to alternate an alcoholic drink with a glass of water to prevent you becoming dehydrated.
